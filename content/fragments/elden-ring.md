So the original _Elden Ring_ went on sale after its DLC release, and I bought it. I almost hate to admit it, but I like it.

After the terrible mistake of buying the PS5 _Demon's Souls_ remake, I swore to myself that I wouldn't buy anything FromSoftware or FromSoftware-adjacent ever again. It's too hard, too obnoxious, and too unforgiving. Like, really hard gameplay I guess I can understand, but then add in a weapon durability element whose only effect is to hurt players already struggling _even more_? F*k off game.

But the praise for _Elden Ring_ from the past few years has been so broad and so unanimous that I finally broke down and bought it, despite my promise.

It's still too hard for me, but it's a big improvement because at least I have a chance. There's no longer a single line of progression, so if I get stuck, I can go and try something else, or find a good site to grind levels for a while. I have to be overleveled for every boss fight, but unlike _Demon's Souls_, I make progress.

Some miscellaneous notes. I know that I'm the last person on Earth to play this game, so nothing new here.

* The depth of the world building (heroes, dragons, demigods, celestial events) is legitimately jaw dropping, but even more amazing is how you won't know about any of it without watching YouTube videos on the subject (it's all hidden away in flavor text).

    The real galaxy brain realization though is that _I actually kind of prefer this_. I don't get much story depth right away, but I avoid mashing buttons for hours grinding through dialog that I really don't care about (*cough*, _Final Fantasy XVI_).

* The expansive open world with megalithic castles and ramparts in the distance --- just amazing. So much latitude in where you can go, and secrets hidden everywhere. The world feels designed, rather than just being some bland, procedurally generated nothing.

* The challenge is frustrating (god I hate being killed by every boss in three hits regardless of upgrades), but it's a fairly rare novelty. I'm often struck these days by how most AAA titles are now the same game.

    Squint a little and _Horizon Zero Dawn_ is the same game as _God of War_ which is the same game as the latest Batman _Arkham_ which is the same game as the latest _Grand Theft Auto_. They all have variations in terms of mechanics and theme, but they're all open worlds with light RPG elements. A common element to all of them is by leveling normally as the story progress, every encounter is basically "mash buttons to win". I don't always love _Elden Ring's_ difficulty, but you have to give them one thing -- it's different.

* The leveling slope is a shallow incline (many extra levels yield marginal increases in power), and it's a good thing. In most games going to a high level area is an iron clad death sentence as you're obliterated instantly, if you're even allowed to go there. In _Elden Ring_ it often is too, but it lets good players move faster to higher level areas and even bad ones to carefully explore there.

* Areas _have_ levels. The autoleveling in games like _Elder Scrolls_ always bothered me. I didn't even like _Skyrim_. If anywhere you go, anything is approachable, nothing feels sacred. The sense of exploration and feeling of discovery are compromised.

* Is _Elden Ring_ the most genuine Dungeons & Dragons game ever made? There's no role-playing element, but it's a vast, explorable world of medieval knights, weapons, magic, undead, and dragons, set in a world of deep lore and hidden stories.

All in all, it's probably too hard for me to finish, but at least I got far enough that I got my money's worth out of it.
