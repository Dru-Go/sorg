Dropbox _was_ one of the best apps ever created. The original program was magic -- a game changer for getting organized and gold standard for how easy-to-use a cloud service should be. But for years the walls have been closing in -- new features that are hard to opt out of (e.g. "Smart Sync"), price increases, an _Electron app_. The latest insult is that they've been unable to ship an M1 binary, so an already bloated app runs even more slowly and resource hungry. The company's now aiming for a release in H1 2022, which will be a full two years after the first M1 developer kits shipped in June 2020.

Yesterday, I solicited feedback on good alternatives on Twitter and got back quite a few thoughtful responses which I'll collate here.

First I'll mention [Maestral](https://maestral.app/), which is an alternate Dropbox client that I hadn't heard of. Migrating off of Dropbox is going to be a painful multi-day effort, so it's far easier to give this a try first. I've been test driving it today to _great_ success -- it's highly refined, about 10x lighter weight than the official app, so far bug-free even on my 100 GB+ account, and most importantly, has an M1 build. It doesn't have all the fancy kernel integrations, but even as someone who'd occasionally use right-click to create share links, I still consider their absence to be a feature overall.

Besides that, by far the most mentioned Dropbox alternatives are:

* **Google Drive:** This one's attractive -- drive space is shareable with Gmail, you almost certainly have a Google account already, and they're not going anywhere.
* **iCloud Drive:** Another big one that many of us are integrated with already. My main aversion to this one is that I don't really trust Apple with anything that's file-like or web-like. I played around with the iCloud web interface and link sharing in Finder and it was _rough_.

Pricing is consistent across the board for the larger plans across all the majors -- Dropbox is $9.99 for 2 TB, Google is $9.99 for 1 TB, and Apple is $9.99 for 2 TB.

Other options that came up:

* [Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud) -- Open-source self-hosted storage and productivity system.
* [Proton Drive](https://protonmail.com/blog/proton-drive-early-access/) -- From the ProtonMail people. No native apps as of yet though.
* [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) -- Open-source program that synchronizes between two computers.
* [Tresorit](https://tresorit.com/) -- Encrypted hosted service. $30 / month for 2.5 TB.
