This used to be a short article about a closed nightclub in San Francisco.
Despite the closure, it was laudatory of the club's owner, who has since
descended very deeply into retrograde politics, so I scrubbed this piece. If
you really want, you can dredge it up from [Git history][git].

Here's a [great article about Berlin's Berghain][berghain] instead.
