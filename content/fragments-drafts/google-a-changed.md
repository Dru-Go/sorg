There's been a lot of chatter about Google lately, spurred by an [18-year veteran employee's layoff](https://social.clawhammer.net/blog/posts/2024-01-10-GoogleExitLetter/), and subsequently followed up by a letter he'd written almost two decades earlier [about his first week at the company](https://social.clawhammer.net/blog/posts/2005-09-25-FirstWeekAtGoogle/). A few highlights:

* Beautiful campus. On-site gyms (with trainers), swimming pools, laundry. Subsidized massages.
* Gourmet food designed by famous chefs including smoke salmon, bistro beef shoulder, duck legs, coconut-encrusted prawns, etc. Mini-kitchens with every drink and snack imaginable.
* All the computer equipment and accessories a young comp sci major's heart could desire.
* The feel of a giant research campus. PhDs. Ad-hoc collaboration. Open, transparent culture. Creative environment. Self-guided -- find projects you're interested in and help them.
* 20% time! Remember that?

It's hard to confirm how much of this still exists, but "not much" is probably a pretty safe bet. These days, Google's public employee perks page largely covers compensation, health plans, and 401ks -- the same pedestrian concerns that you'd find at other companies not famous for their vibrant cultures. Meals are still free, but presumably in a form that's somewhat more modest than the luxuries above.

It's funny how time works. I still remember around that time hearing the grandiose stories of lavish campuses like Google's and for many years assumed that they were still like that, before it eventually dawned on me these stories were now quite dated, and slowly but surely, things had likely changed.

## Unsolicited editorial (#editorial)

On laying off veteran employees: The aged amongst us will remember Microsoft's unpopular stack ranking program, which they ended to great applause [back in 2013](https://archive.is/0p4GM). But stack ranking didn't go anywhere, it just moved underground. Although not official policy, I strongly suspect that all major tech companies are engaging in some form of this (one big one I worked for certainly did), and tenure doesn't confer immunity. I'm not sure if that's what happened to the person above, but a modern worker at big tech with survivalist instincts should do everything in their power to outcompete their peer group. Assume that the company feels no loyalty towards you (or any other emotions) regardless of past achievement [1].

I find it amusing (but not surprising) that huge tech companies soften their image internally by using cutesy language like "Nooglers" (new Googlers), despite being cold, uncompromising, two-trillion dollar engines for profit. I don't mean for that to sound derogatory (speaking as a Canadian, Americans should be proud of these businesses that have garnered so much success), just as a fact. Stripe had a version of this involving llamas as an official mascot (llamas are cute, but tough), and internal memes like [laughing Gandalf sax guy loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sagg08DrO5U).

To the credit of the two-trillion profit engines, I like this [Hacker News comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39054021):

> Google 10-15 years ago had a clear idea of how to win: hire the best programmers, give them freedom, and they'll build products that will win in every market. And, well, that hasn't happened. Long before the current talk of Google's decline, there was talk of the Google black hole, where talented people would get hired and their noteworthy output would drop to zero. It turned out hiring great programmers wasn't enough by itself, not many amazing new products were happening. That's what caused Google to change culture toward the corporate norm: the non-normal culture wasn't proving itself.

I can't speak for what happened at Google, but this bears some relation to my observations at early Heroku, slight post-acquisition where money and resources suddenly became a nonissue overnight. Given a company of some of the smartest, most passionate people around, it was kind of amazing how little got done.

To be clear, a lot did get gone, but a lot _didn't_. We had personnel and teams who's output over a period of _years_ was so negligible that it could safely be rounded to zero. Many people are excellent, self-motivated workers who could live in an organizational vacuum and still be shipping all day long. But many other people (even very smart ones) need assists from product to shape their tech demos and passion projects into something useful, and some light oversight and accountability imputed by a managerial structure to stay on target. A pet theory of mine is that many functional companies come to realize this, and put in structures designed to guarantee that regardless of any person in the org's individual level of initiative, cadence is maintained and products ship on a regular basis.
