I'm back home in Calgary for the holidays, staring into the precipice of 2023 which between money markets, strife, and war is shaping up to be a formidable year.

At work, we're cruising along building the best database-as-a-service in the world. I shipped more features over the last year than the previous five combined, and which were built into a robust stack that to this day has less tech debt than many two-week-old startups (I'm kind of proud of it, you might be able to tell). We have another aggressive roadmap for 2023, and I'll be doing my best to make sure that we don't slip.

I added a couple new sections to the site recently:

* [**Atoms:**](/atoms) Short multimedia particles minus the stress of a social media platform ([atom feed](/atoms.atom)).
* [**Sequences:**](/sequences) Periodic large format photos paired with prose. An older project, but one which I recently revived, flattened, and republished.

A few weeks before that I became somewhat enamored by the idea of [Spring '83](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/specifying-spring-83/) and ended up [writing a server implementation](https://github.com/brandur/neospring) which is now in prod and [hosts my board](https://neospring.brandur.org/). I don't think Twitter is being displaced anytime soon, but these indy web projects are great.

In 2023: write, move, visit France.

## Apr 5, 2020

It's 2020. Like for almost everyone else on Earth, COVID-19 is top-of-mind. I'm working from home, San Francisco is sheltering in place, and the future is a hugely uncertain time.

{{HTMLRender (ImgSrcAndAltAndClass "/assets/images/now/twin-peaks-stairs.jpg" "Stairs up to Twin Peaks" "overflowing")}}

As bad as our present day situation is, an indefinite work from home policy has given me more flexibility and more energy in my day-to-day than I've ever had in my adult life, and I'm going to do my best not to waste it.

Some things I’m working on:

* Write every day, and try to so fluidly. Instead of agonizing over every word, get content down, revise, and revise again. Some projects:

    * A (roughly) weekly newsletter called <em>Nanoglyph</em>. I’m challenging myself to send at least 30 editions in 2020, and do so without compromising content quality. You should <a href="https://nanoglyph-signup.brandur.org/">try subscribing</a>.
    * A development log with notes on daily software discoveries and projects. Most entries will be of minor interest, but frequent enough to build writing cadence. <a href="/fragments/google-cloud-run-deploy">For example</a>.

* Meditate every day.

/   li Write more, and more fluidly. Instead of agonizing over every word, get content down, revise, and revise again.
/   li The craft of software has landed on a plateau where big, complicated, fragile backend deployments that support slow, underwhelming, buggy frontend products is the norm. Find techniques and ideas to reverse this trend and boost their signal.
/   li Ran 1000 miles and did 42k pushups in 2019, do so again in 2020. Keep weight at ~150 lbs. Zero in on ~10% body fat.
/   li Reboot meditation practice. Did pretty well in 2018, but fell off the wagon completely in 2019. Aim for a couple 30 consecutive day runs.

/   li <A href="/sequences-project">A photography project called <strong><em>Sequences</em></strong></a> as an experiment to promote the independent web.
/   li A tiny static site framework that encourages stability through writing build recipes in a compiled language instead of in untyped templates, or having them implied through file organization.
/   li Writing on topics like <del>WebSockets</del> (<a href="/live-reload">done</a>), operable databases, and stability through data constraints.
/   li Nutrition and fitness: Leaner diet, run 1000 miles in 2019. Targeting <150 lbs. and ~10% body fat.

/   li Exercising my <a href="https://twitter.com/brandur/statuses/823588112488013824">attention muscle</a> by putting in more periods of deep thought and intense non-maintenance work. I wake up early, and try to focus on only one thing at a time.



## November 26, 2017

/ p I'm in Japan, visiting its unique duality of the most beautiful natural and urban environments in the world, decompressing from the ever-turning treadmill of electronic life, writing, and visiting as many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onsen">onsens</a> as I can find.



## September 18, 2017

/ p I'm in Canada enjoying its exceptional natural beauty during the final days of summer, visiting family, and attending the weddings of a few of my oldest friends.



## January 23rd, 2016

/ I'm in San Francisco concentrating on self-discipline, self-improvement, and shipping the next big thing at Stripe.



## Other old stuff

/ li Seeking to deeply understand some of my favorite pieces of technology like Postgres and Rust, and transforming those findings into published material.
/ li Writing an aspirational guide for building software that's simple, robust, and stable without constant human attention.
/ li Some basic voice recording to help me get more articulate and be able to form more cohesive long form thoughts in speech.
