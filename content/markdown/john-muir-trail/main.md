## Day 1, glamping (#day-1)

Like everyone knows, the best way to start any trip is with a flat tire.

On the final stretch of the narrow road up to Vermillion Camp, windows open, we hear a sudden pop and the distinctive sound of air rushing out of a narrow opening at high speed. I had three seconds of ignorant bliss wondering what that sound was before it became the distinct sound of rubbery tread unambiguously signaling a flat. Being the only vehicle in a mile in any direction, there wasn't much question as to who the puncture belonged to.

Better yet, it's a rental. We're not even sure that there's a spare, let alone where to find it. It's a Jeep. Remember when the spare tire on a Jeep hung off the back door, as obvious as the sun in a clear blue sky? But this is 2023, the year of the undifferentiated SUV design, and the storied Jeep is no different, looking just like every other SUV on the road. Ten minutes and a lot of experimentation later, someone finally decides to RTFM, we realize that the spare is mounted out of sight on the car's undercarriage, and is manually winched down using a special access port hidden under a plastic button in the trunk.

That's the bad news. The good is that there's literally no better time _ever_ to get a flat than when you're on vacation with a loose schedule and a bunch your guy buddies. A flat tire becomes a team building activity, with everyone pitching advice and labor. What was a somewhat worrying situation a few minutes ago becomes benign as between the five of us we manage to dredge from memory 95%+ of best practices for jacking a car and changing a tire without referencing Google.

We finish with a lopsided vehicle (the spare isn't full sized), but one that's drivable, and make our way into Vermillion, finding our campsite to be in a prime location on the shores of Lake Edison.

This first day is for driving, acclimatization, and for some of us to get used to our equipment. I haven't been backpacking in a long time, and am in awe at how much technology as improved:

* I'm carrying a full-sized freestanding tent that weighs only two pounds. Its even got UX features like poles and latch points that are color coordinated to maximize the ease in which it can be assembled.

* I borrowed a modern air mattress (thanks Farina). It has two separate levels of valve granularity that let it to be easily inflated and deflated in two minutes each. It provides practically perfect insulation from the ground.

* I borrowed an REI-brand lightweight down quilt, which is like a sleeping bag with no bottom layer, but can be jammed back into its stuff sack in under a minute, a job that used to be an arduous ~5 minutes for synthetic sleeping bags when I was a kid. Amazing.

That night we stop in for dinner at Vermillion's small cafe, and are treated to some ludicrously large fajitas (this appelation challenged by several members of our group who believe them to be more like quesidillas). We're overcharged for beer, but buy some anyway. It's our last opportunity for this sort of luxury, along freerunning water and power for quite a while.

Another camper stops by our site in the morning and tells us that she's been coming here for decades and it's the first time in many years that Lake Edison looks full and beautiful. Drought conditions in California have meant that it's been a long time since the area's looked this pretty.

We swim in the lake before leaving. The air is warm. The water is refreshing, but very cold.

## Day 2, snakefront property (#day-2)

The next day, after a hearty breakfast we drive back out of the campground to find parking along the feeder road. For the next two hours we search for a new freeform wilderness campsite for the night. We coin the term "Farinateering", which roughly means "bushwhacking in circles carrying heavy objects for many hours before eventually arriving at a destination that was 15 minutes from the road along a well-worn path". That's okay, none of us are interested in the easy way out.

We decide to pitch along the shores of Doris Lake, midway between Lake Edison and the Mono Hot Springs.

After many hours of exhausting Farinateering, Umur, a wise executive, determines the only wise course of action available, which is to take a midday nap on an unusually ergonomically-sound rock.

Rob investigates the feasibility of escaping the lake via bouldering a sheer granite slab. It doesn't occur to me until much later, but the photo is a microcosm for our progress on the trip.

I find my most epic tent pitch of the entire trip. If you're going to visit Beverly Hills Rock, please make sure to pick up a guest pass at the guard booth, pleb. This is top dollar lakefront property.

We hike into the Mono Hot Springs campground for dinner and one last resupply. One half of our party gets lost on the way and runs into a large rattlesnake in the rocks, but isn't overly concerned about it.

Once reaching the campground every one of us orders one last burger (except Umur, who orders a blackened fish fillet). Our waiter is an incredibly pleasant European from Prague that calls us all "sir". We finish late and walk the mile back to camp by the light of our headlamps.

## Day 3 (#day-3)

Day 3 is really day 1, where the trip gets real and we start hiking long distances. We say goodbye to Umur, the car, and heavy luxuries like our cast iron pan, camp chairs, and dignity, and get hiking.

For the first time, we realize just how heavy our packs are, how hot California is, and how far we still have to go. I take a sunburn on the lips that'll last all week and into the next.

Farina starts to use the word "exogenous" a lot, one that I haven't heard since high school science courses. We all pretend that we're speaking mutually intelligible English language, but secretly, none of us know what the hell he's talking about.

That is, until he jumps into the first creek we find, fully clothed. The idea is to cool onself using an _exogenous_ source of water, thereby conserving your internal supply. It's really hot so this seems like a magnificent idea to the rest of us, and we all follow suit.

The day is spent hiking from the road up Bear Creek Trail to the point where it intersects with the JMT and PCT, which are functionally the same thing along this stretch. We camp by a creek shortly after, starting to get used to the dramatically reduced number of people we're now seeing, with our only neighbors being a couple evening headlamps visible in the distance one campsite over.

## Day 4, Seldon Pass (#day-4)

Day 4 is our first major push of the entire trip, planned at 15 miles, but more like 20 by the end of the day. We're still getting used to sleeping on the trail, but spirits are high.

We go up over Seldon Pass, passing by many beautiful alpine lakes -- Marshall Lake and Marie Lake on the way up, followed by Heart Lake and Sallie Keys Lake on the other side.

We eat lunch at the top of the pass, meeting Keith, a PCTer who we've been intermittently passing and being passed by all day, and another fellow from Glasgow.

After a previous bad experience with marmots, Rob doesn't like marmots, and spends as much time chasing them away from his pack as he does eating food. The marmots go hungry, but appear unphased as they wait for the next hiker to come through.

And now back down the other side.

Rob picked up his vintage 80s pack at a thrift store and despite being heavier than anything else on the mountain, it's a huge hit on the trail. Everyone we speak to for more than a few minutes comments on it. Often it takes less than time than that, and sometimes it's the _only_ thing someone notices about our party.

There are many water crossings along the trail. We quickly learn that although it's _often_ possible to use stones and logs to get to the other side without getting your feet wet, it's just as often _not_ possible. Some hikers carry a pair of sandals to change in and out of around unavoidable submarine crossings, but in the spirit of exogenism, all four of us wade straight in.

I realize that I've internally redefined the word "dry" from its traditional sense to mean "not having walked through a creek in the last half hour".

At the other end of the lake we pass a group of hikers going the other way who tell us that we're in for an "epic downhill". Having just traversed a pass we thought we were largely done for the day, so it didn't immediately register. We were indeed in for an _epic_ downhill involving miles worth of switchbacks down to Shooting Star Meadow.

We hadn't realized it going in, but this would be our longest stretch without easy access to water. Luckily it was on the downhill for us, but we pass a number of very thirsty people on the way up. One parched-looking Australian in particular I realize in retrospect I should've offered a refill to.

It was a long day and we arrive at our campsite along the gushing Piute River in the last hour of daylight. We laud ourselves on almost 20 miles walked when a guy comes in who tells us that he's done 30 miles -- effectively hiking the same distance that we did in two days in one. None of us wants to hear it. Go find your own campsite!

Golden hour out here is tremendous, with the valleys having already fallen into mostly darkness, but with the final rays of the sun still illuminating the mountainsides. Here's the Pavilion Dome, towering above us.

I walk around at night a little and find a scorpion, albeit one of only modest size. One of the surprises of the Sierra Nevada for me is how little fauna there is of any size compared to the Rockies. In the Rockies it's not uncommon to come across larger wildlife like bighorn sheep or various members of the deer family, but at all times the ground is teeming with all kinds of insects and arachnids, whereas in the Sierras I've mostly come across only mosquitoes and blackflies (which the Rockies also have plenty of). It's a little disappointing, but to be honest, I don't miss the giant wolf spiders that run faster than I do much.

The days and nights are now a little cooler. Farina isn't jumping into as many rivers as before, and switches from saying "exogenous" to "endogenous".

## Day 5, San Walkin' (#day-5)

Our big job of the day will be to make it across the San Joaquin, which in previous years had a bridge across it, but one that was destroyed this season by higher than normal water flow.

The JMT eventually crosses _back_ over the San Joaquin, so Farina had originally plotted us on an "up and over" route that involved avoiding the initial crossing and instead scrambling a cliffside and descending further up the trail. This option would've been a bit of a slog though, so we'd been talking to hikers going the other to ask after what they'd done to get across, and the nearly universal reply is that they'd forded the river a little downstream from where the bridge was out, saying that it was possible to find places where the water was about thigh deep and not running too fast.

We found that someone had thoughtfully built a cairn near a good crossing point, and as other hikers had reported, had no trouble getting across.

<figure><img src="/photographs{{DownloadedImage .Ctx "/john-muir-trail/san-joaquin-1" "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/08frjq3o2aj6z8uyzgbiz/2W4A4094.JPG?rlkey=829gr61xpkpacxfpazmxrj29n&dl=1" 1200}}" loading="lazy"></figure>

A team of National Forest Service employees had set up camp in the area so they could work towards clearing the remains of the bridge.

Eager to demonstrate their bonafides as federal employees, they were unfriendly to a degree that seemed to indicate that they thought they were actors satirically playing federal employees in an SNL skit, refusing to acknowledge basic greetings, and casting dangerous looks in our direction if we looked like we might be getting too close. They'd littered the area with snide signs to make it clear that _nothing_ resembling basic humanity should be expected under _any_ circumstances.

The rest of the day was spent hiking up along Evolution Valley, considered by many to be the most beautiful spot in Kings Canyon National Park, a claim that I can endorse.

Our pitch that night was one of the most picturesque, sleeping under the shadow of The Hermit, a 12,000+ foot peak. There were a couple very nice campsites, but the mosquitoes were quite bad, so we ended up pitching away from meadows on a long granite slab. Unfortunately that didn't do much to deter the mosquitoes, so we ate quickly and had an early bedtime.

To enter my tent I'd run 50 feet to the other end of our granite slab, temporarily discombobulating the cloud buzzing around me, then 50 feet back in the other direction, nosediving through as narrow of an opening in my its entryway as I could make.

## Day 6, Muir Pass (#day-6)

We hadn't spotted anyone around our camping are the previous day and had assumed that we were largely alone up there, but the next morning we find a surprising number of backpackers passing us in both directions, suggesting that they must've camped nearly (or gotten up very early). We're a little slow in packing up camp and I use the opportunity to try and dry clothes on our giant rock slab and array a bank of solar panels I'd brought along to recharge my general purpose battery pack.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, I've found that I've vastly overestimated my power requirements for the trip, and could've left the solar panels at home. I've been reading a Kindle every night before bed, but it's still at 90%+ charge. My iPhone in airplane mode has been holding a steady 40-60% charge for three days now. My camera and headlamp could've probably made the whole trip without a recharge. Low-power chips, LED lights, and lithium batteries have made backpacking much easier than it used to be, but I'm still spending an inordinate amount of time monitoring power levels that can only be explained by a creeping digital addiction to which we've all fallen prey.

Today, another pass, once again decorated by alpine lakes. This one is named for the man himself: Muir Pass.

At the top of the pass is the John Muir Memorial Shelter, built 1931 to commemorate Muir and serve as an emergency shelter for high-reaching climbers. I wasn't expecting it to be so thoroughly well-built, cut from the very stone surrounding it.

I meet a solo backpacker in her early 20s inside who tells me that the hut represents almost exactly the halfway point of the JMT and her trip. It's a popular place to meet and greet, and some of our party spends some time inside shooting the breeze with other hikers.

I hike without poles or microspikes, something that used to be perfectly normal for almost all of human history, but which has become unusual in the last decade or so.

Other backpackers in the hut warn for 47th time this trip that without these critical tools I'm a dead man. You hear me? DEAD. It is simply not humanly possible to cross a patch of 50 feet of slushy snow unaided. I nod solemnly and say that I've accepted my fate. Could they please say a nondemoninational prayer for me once they reach the other side.

Now that gravity's on our side again, some members of our crew find shortcuts down the mountain.

Although finally on the descent, we still have quite a long way to go and are racing the clock to make a good campsite before sunset. Part of this is our late start, but we also seem to be very good at pacing our days so that we use every last minute of daylight. Not a bad thing necessarily, but it necessitates a quick march for the last few miles to make sure we're not setting up our tents by headlamp.

We find a campsite near the river that's a stone throw's distance away from a ranger cabin. With a long day behind us and mosquitoes bad again, we allow ourselves the luxury of a campfire, which is permitted again now that we're back below 10,000 feet. It's a huge hit and helps keep the bugs away.

After a week's discussion of overly heavy backpacks and our various investments in ultralight equipment, Rob breaks out Laphroaig, which he's been carrying in the kind of steel flask seen in movies that's so robust that you can carry it in a breastpocket, pretend to be dead after someone shoots you in the chest, only to jump back into action as it turns out the flask absorbed the entire force of the bullet. It must weigh at least a pound.

## Day 7, Bishop Pass (#day-7)

Overnight we experience an atmospheric effect that's highly unusual in California: rain. It pitter patters softly on our tents all night long. I'm glad my equipment is reasonably waterproof because I hadn't even tried to stow my pack.

Today we head up over Bishop Pass on our way to resupply at Parchers, where we've shipped containers of extra food and provisions. It's by far our moodiest day atmospherically, with mountains cloaked in clouds, and giving off real Ansel Adams vibes.

On our way up we encounter yet another broken bridge. This one's even more problematic because it's still proximately in one piece, but looks like it could break apart at any moment, and teeters precipitously at the edge of a waterfall and long drop below.

<figure><img src="/photographs{{DownloadedImage .Ctx "/john-muir-trail/bishop-pass-09" "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/jkdvgb27cqosprbykz6j6/2W4A4365-bridge.JPG?rlkey=9xxkxdyrxrenu9otlbgz3qj5w&dl=1" 1200}}" loading="lazy"></figure>

We opt to go up and over a series of rocks twenty feet above, giving us a little extra span to catch ourselves in case of a fall, but which in retrospect, is safer than the broken bridge by only the most marginal possible extent.

The day is our longest day so far, with 4,000 feet of elevation gain on the way up to the pass. We make it over, down to a parking lot for day hikes on the other side, and walk the rest of the way along the road to Parchers.

<hr>

This is when we commit our greatest error of the trip. We collect our resupply buckets at Parchers, but everyone had been looking forward to a preferrably-very-unhealthy meal not cooked on a camp stove, which their website seemed to indicate would be available there, but wasn't. We decided to catch a ride down into the town of Bishop -- two of us wanted to end their trip after this leg, and would have to go there anyway. We were warned that because this was festival weekend in Bishop (coinciding with Labor Day), accommodation might be hard to find, but were stuck in an awkward place because with zero cellular connectivity in the area (and Parchers unwilling to give us their wifi password), we couldn't check for accommodation in Bishop without actually _going_ to Bishop.

In Bishop we find the very unhealthy meal that we were looking for, but find that accommodation is indeed a problem, and a big one. We're initially surprised by how tight accommodation seems to be despite a littany of motels in every direction, but in the age of Expedia, Kayak, AirBnB, Hotels.com, and Hotwire, assume that it's only a matter of time until we find something. But over the next two hours it dawns on us that there is _nothing_, not one room, campsite, or cupboard in a hundred miles in any direction. Not only that, but there's also no Lyft, Uber, or even taxis. Not only that, but it's the long weekend, so there's also no shuttles to anywhere else in the next two days. Not only that, but no car rental agencies are open, and even if they were, won't allow a one-way rental at any price. By the time 10 PM rolls around, we're sitting in a bar with heavy backpacks, full resupply buckets, and no prospects. Things are grim.

<hr>

The good news is that it's a small town and people are nice. Our server give us exhaustive local advice, and the bar's owner lets us store our resupply buckets there overnight. In a moment of desperation Rob and Farina actually walk into the local police precinct and feed them the line, "look, we're not trying to break any laws, but say you had a hypothetical situation that was so dire that the only available option was to camp in a public park ..." The officer tells them that in this hypothetical situation, if caught, the infractors would be told to move along, something that backpackers are fairly well known to do anyway.

There's BLM (Bureau of Land Management) land five miles out of the city, but we have no way to get to it. Besides the nearest public park, our one remaining prospect is to see if we can camp on the fairgrounds, which the website suggests is possible. We start walking that direction, even as Peter's still calling motels to confirm that there's indeed really-absolutely-nothing-available. Farina stops in at one last hotel and the staff there help him call a municipal shuttle that seems to still be running. The shuttle driver answers the phone and tells us that he's coming to pick us up. No one is exactly sure where we're being picked up to go _to_.

He arrives and introduces himself as "Nightrider". It's the shortest trip of our lives. Nightrider drives us a mile outside of town, points to a field along which a number of RVs appear to be parked (and appear to have been for quite some time), and assures this that this is where he's taken backpackers to sleep before. As we get out, he looks us in the eyes, and says solemnly, "Look, if anybody gives you any trouble, just tell them: Nightrider sent you." Tick off one more thing that I'd never expected to hear in real life.

Farina rigs up a tarp, and still incredulous at the absurdity of the situation, we wall get under it to sleep.

<hr>

## Day 8, retreat (#day-8)

Something I learn about Bishop -- it's windy. _Really_ windy. We sleep, but with a galeforce that seems to blowing at 100 MPH all night, not well, waking up tired and demoralized. (Well, all of us except Farina, who woke up at the crack of dawn to see what advice he could procure over an omelette at the local Denny's.)

We break camp and go find breakfast. After more smartphoning we come to realize that there's no way out of this town for at least two more days after the end of the holiday weekend. No way out _except_ for one last flight at 2 PM to SFO before the leg ends for the entire season. Impulsively, two of the party book tickets immediately, and after some hesitation, the rest of us do too.

Homeless and barely awake, the thought of hitchhiking our way back up to the trailhead and hiking all the way back over Bishop Pass to continue our journey is hard to swallow right now. Farina's backpacking spirit is indomitable and he'll do it, but with a planeride I have to catch next week to Charleston acting as a hard ratchet on our schedule, and with just about the worst night of sleep I've ever had, I'm hesitant.

We've become acquaintances with a young Norwegian PCTer. Although not traveling with him, everywhere we go, he's already there, and we use his omnipresence to our advantage to hand off as many supplies as he's willing to take. Farina's trademarked food item is Target trail mix with sunflower seeds mixed in to fill gaps and maximize caloric density. After a short sales pitch, he hands off a few gallons of the stuff, and from the look of the PCTer who's a skinny 150 lbs. of sinewy muscle, he could use it.

Bishop's airport is the smallest I've ever seen. We make friends with another backpacker from Sonoma on the way there, and talk about film cameras and black bears before a one-hour flight home that compared to last night, feels a little _too_ easy.
