At the tail end of summer 2023, a ragtag band set out to hike the [John Muir Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Muir_Trail) (JMT), a long-distance push over the Sierra Nevada in California, starting in the Yosemite area and ending with a climb over Mount Whitney, the tallest peak in the lower 48.

The John Muir shouldn't be confused with the [Pacific Crest Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail) (PCT), a much longer trail that runs the entire span of the United States' western coast, but over this part of California they're one and the same. As you're walking the JMT as a long-distance, [ultralight](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/)-obsessed, travel-worn backpacker, it's not unusual to come across (and usually be passed by) another breed of even _longer_-distance, even more ultralight-obsessed, and even more travel-worn backpacker, as they go about their 4 to 6 month sojourn walking America from border to border.

An end-to-end run of the JMT typically takes three weeks. With all of us working age and somewhat time-constrained, we were planning to do shortened version of it in two, but even this more modest project ended early (read on).

2023 was a year of unusual high precipitation in California, which left the whole area beautifully green and with resevoirs and creeks at their fullest in a decade, but is also the reason we waited until late August for the hike, to give the mountain snow atop the Sierras a chance to recede.
