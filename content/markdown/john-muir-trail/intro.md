On the trailing edge of summer 2023, a ragtag band set out to hike the [John Muir Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Muir_Trail) (JMT), a long-distance push over the Sierra Nevada in California, starting in the Yosemite area and ending with a climb over Mount Whitney, the tallest peak in the lower 48. An end-to-end run typically takes three weeks. Being a little more time-constrained we were planning to do only a part of it in two, although ended early even on that more modest project (read on).

The John Muir shouldn't be confused with the [Pacific Crest Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail) (PCT), a much longer trail that runs the entire height of the United States' western coast, but over this part of California they're the same trail. As you're walking the JMT as a long-distance, lightness-obsessed, fit backpacker, it's not unusual to come across (and often be passed by) another breed of backpacker who is even _longer_-distance, even more lightness-obsessed, and even more fit, as they go about their 4 to 6 month walkabout.
