At the trailing end of summer 2023, a ragtag band set out to hike the [John Muir Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Muir_Trail) (JMT), a long-distance push over the Sierra Nevada in California, starting in the Yosemite area and ending with a climb over Mount Whitney, the tallest peak in the lower 48.

The John Muir shouldn't be confused with the [Pacific Crest Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail) (PCT), a much longer trail that runs the entire span of the United States' western coast, but over this part of California they're the same trail. As you're walking the JMT as a long-distance, [ultralight](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/)-obsessed, travel-worn backpacker, it's not unusual to come across (and usually be passed by) another breed of even _longer_-distance, even more ultralight-obsessed, and even more travel-worn backpacker, as they go about their 4 to 6 month sojourn walking America from border to border.

An end-to-end run of the JMT typically takes three weeks. Being a little more time-constrained we were planning to do only a part of it in two, although ended early even on that more modest project (read on). 2023 was a year of unusual high precipitation in California, which left the whole area beautifully green and with resevoirs and creeks fuller than normal, but is also the reason we waited until late August, to give the mountain snow a chance to melt.
