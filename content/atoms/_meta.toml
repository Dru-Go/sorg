Properties assessed at a total of $59 billion have [requested resassessment](https://archive.vn/ma4Nk), having correctly recognized that owning downtown real estate in 2022 is not as valuable of a proposition as it was in 2020. Adjustment would bring the total down to $26 billion, translating to $308 million in lost property tax revenue should all their reassessments succeed. Add that to the already identified $728 million hole in the budget over the next two years.

Claimed by the article: San Francisco was slow to work due to a high concentration of "tech and professional services".

Omitted from the article: after spending a decade spent increasing tax and slathering on red tape, San Francisco locks down earliest in the nation, and for the longest, keeping major restrictions in place until just a few months ago. Add decades worth of obstructionism having contributed to some of the priciest rents and real estate on the planet, in a major surprise young workers didn't find it a compelling place to hunker down for three years of life in stasis, and businesses didn't find it compelling to sit on three years worth of empty offices.

The good news: San Franciscans achieved their final victory in driving out The Bad People. The bad news: rents are as high as ever, the budget is a smoking crater in the ground, and the 70s didn't come back.

The other day I found that my automated job to cross-post to a toy Spring '83 board started failing, with the reason being that my last [sequences](/sequences) entry was more than 22 days ago. Not good -- I'd intended to keep them more up-to-date than that -- but I don't always have anything new to post.

I've always like the idea of `.plan` files, tiny plaintext files that live in a user's home directory and which would be dumped using the `finger` command on a target user. Famously, John Carmack published them for [more than a decade](https://github.com/ESWAT/john-carmack-plan-archive). Here, in a similar spirit to `.plan`, introduce "atoms", tiny multimedia particles that are fast and easy to write. Along with sequence entries, they're cross-posted to Spring '83, and will also live at [`/atoms`](/atoms).

Xmas morning. A signature gift was a new Zojirushi rice cooker, so I'll graduating from cooking rice in my old steamer (even if you don't recognize the name, their elephant logo is conspicuous worldwide).

Zojirushi reminds me of the old Heroku office at 321 11th St, where we had a number of their vacuum boilers. They'd keep water at perfect coffee-brewing temperature, ready to make a Chemex pourover at any moment.
