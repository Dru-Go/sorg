# This script tries to ensure that all scalar images (i.e. a ".jpg" or a
# ".png") have a companion retina file, that is one that has a "@2x" before the
# extension and is 4x the resolution of its original. The script runs in CI to
# try and keep me from getting lazy and not finding retina assets.
#
# This is so that images look better on retina displays like newer Mac laptops,
# iPhones, and iPads. While the sources of images still point to the non-retina
# version, a JS script that's loaded (retina.js) replaces them with retina
# content in the DOM if appropriate for a user's device.
